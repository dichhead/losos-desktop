# The build host, as a file.
#
# `docs/host-requirements.md` is the list of programs a recipe invokes directly
# and this tree therefore cannot supply -- pm resolves every step's first word
# on the host and mirrors the host's `/usr` into the jail read-only (C1, C3, C7
# in `docs/pm-constraints.md`), so there is no bootstrap step that could install
# one. That list has until now been prose: a human read it, installed things,
# and found out whether they had the right versions by running a four-hour build
# and watching where it stopped.
#
# This is that list made executable, and it is the same image in CI and on a
# developer's machine. `docs/container.md` is the reasoning; what follows is
# only the pins and the reasons a particular package is here.
#
# Three inputs decide what lands in the image, and two of them are pinned:
#
#   * mkosi, by commit, below -- because its configuration surface is part of
#     this repository's source;
#   * the Rust toolchain, by version, because it does not come from the
#     distribution at all.
#
# The third -- the distribution's own packages -- is NOT pinned, and that is a
# deliberate call rather than an omission. See the tombstone below.

# Arch Linux. Rolling, and current with upstream in a way that matters here:
# this tree is clang-only by design (no gcc, no binutils, no ld.bfd; see
# docs/host-requirements.md) and Arch ships clang, lld, mold and LLVM as one
# unversioned set, kept in step with each other, rather than as a versioned
# package family a distribution froze at some point in its cycle.
#
# `base` rather than `base-devel`: base-devel pulls in gcc and binutils, which
# is exactly the GNU toolchain docs/host-requirements.md says is not required
# and which this image has no use for. A compiler nothing invokes is still a
# compiler a build system can autodetect and reach for.
#
# It is an argument rather than a literal because **Arch upstream is an
# x86_64-only distribution and publishes no aarch64 image**. `archlinux:base`
# carries one manifest, linux/amd64, so the aarch64 leg of the build matrix --
# which runs natively on an arm64 runner and routes every layer through this
# image -- cannot pull it at all:
#
#     choosing an image from manifest list docker://archlinux:base: no image
#     found in image index for architecture arm64, variant "v8", OS linux
#
# ARM is Arch Linux ARM, a separate project with its own build farm, and it
# publishes rootfs tarballs rather than images -- so the aarch64 base is a
# third-party rebuild of that tree. `tools/container` picks which one from the
# architecture it is running on; the default here is the x86_64 answer, so a
# plain `docker build -f Containerfile .` on a developer's machine still works.
#
# What this costs: the two legs of the matrix are no longer on the same
# toolchain version, because Arch Linux ARM lags Arch, and half the matrix
# rests on an image maintainer who is not Arch. Deliberate, and the narrower
# of the two options -- the package list below is unchanged by it, since Arch
# Linux ARM is Arch's package tree rebuilt rather than a distribution of its
# own. `docs/container.md` has the rest.

# Tombstone: this file used to be `FROM debian:trixie-slim` with a
# `DEBIAN_SNAPSHOT=<timestamp>` argument pointing apt at snapshot.debian.org,
# and that snapshot was the only reason the base was Debian -- it is the one
# public, timestamped archive, so `apt-get install` resolved against contents
# that could not move under us. Arch has no equivalent, and this image is
# therefore **no longer reproducible across rebuilds**: two builds of this file
# a week apart install different package versions.
#
# That is not an oversight and it is not coming back by accident. It was asked
# and answered: reproducibility of the build *host* was traded for currency of
# the toolchain, knowingly. What it costs is bounded by what this image is --
# see "What it is not" in docs/container.md: nothing from this image ends up in
# losos.qcow2. The distribution is compiled from `manifest/sources.lock`, which
# is pinned by SHA-256 and unaffected; what floats is the set of host programs
# that did the compiling. Anyone re-pinning this should re-pin it on purpose
# and say so, not restore a snapshot URL because this comment looks like a gap.
#
# The one thing that floats and is worth watching: `recipes/00-toolchain/
# compiler-rt` is version-locked to the host clang by intent, and its pin in
# manifest/sources.lock does not move when Arch's clang does. That lock was
# already loose on Debian trixie (clang 19 against compiler-rt 18.1.8); it is
# now loose by however far Arch has run ahead. A mismatch surfaces at the first
# CFI link in `losos-00-toolchain`, which is early and loud, rather than
# silently.

# The Rust toolchain is pinned because it does not come from the distribution:
# `rustup target add <arch>-unknown-linux-musl` is a host requirement (see
# docs/host-requirements.md) and a distribution rustc cannot satisfy it.
#
# It also has to be new enough to build pm, which is a constraint from another
# repository: pm depends on wasmtime for the plugin sandbox, and wasmtime 47
# requires 1.94.0. Too old and the failure is forty lines of
# "wasmtime-internal-<thing> requires rustc 1.94.0", which names the crate
# that noticed rather than the pin that is wrong. Raise this when pm's tree
# raises its floor; there is nothing here that can detect it.
ARG RUST_VERSION=1.94.0

# Tombstone: an `LLVM_VERSION` argument used to be here, naming the LLVM the
# image installs. It existed only because Debian versions its LLVM package
# names and its install prefix -- `llvm-19-dev`, `/usr/lib/llvm-19/bin` -- and
# the file had to spell the same number in the package list and again in a loop
# that made the unversioned `llvm-ar`, `llvm-nm` and friends Debian does not
# guarantee. Arch installs one LLVM, unversioned, with its tools already on
# /usr/bin, so both the argument and that loop have nothing left to do.

# No SHELL directive: podman builds OCI images by default and ignores one with
# a warning, so anything relying on `sh -eux` would be relying on a line that
# did nothing. Every RUN below chains with `&&` instead, which fails on the
# first error under any shell.

# pacman 7 downloads inside a sandbox of its own: it drops to the `alpm` user
# and confines the download process with a Landlock ruleset. A container build
# is not allowed to apply one, so the whole transaction dies before a single
# database is fetched:
#
#     error: restricting filesystem access failed because the Landlock ruleset
#            could not be applied: Operation not permitted
#     error: switching to sandbox user 'alpm' failed!
#     error: failed to synchronize all databases (failed to retrieve some files)
#
# The official `archlinux` image already ships a pacman.conf with this turned
# off -- `scripts/make-rootfs.sh` in archlinux/archlinux-docker does it, with
# the comment "No kernel landlock in containerd" -- which is why the x86_64 leg
# passed and only the aarch64 one, on a third-party rebuild that does not, hit
# this. So it is done here rather than assumed of a base image: one code path,
# and on a base that already did it the edit rewrites the line to itself.
#
# The directive was renamed as pacman split the sandbox in two, so which one to
# write is decided by what the shipped pacman.conf knows about, the same way
# Arch's own script decides it. Writing the wrong name would be worse than
# useless: an unrecognised directive is a warning, so it would look applied and
# fail identically at the next step.
#
# The `[options]` block is printed afterwards because this edit is invisible if
# it silently matches nothing -- the failure then arrives at the step below,
# wearing the package list rather than naming the config.
